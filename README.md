# Line-of-Sight-Algorithm
An algorithm to calculate line of sight given an array of terrain. See output generated by testing case.

This serves only as a proof of concept for the algorithm, inputs and outputs should be changed to suit the users needs.
There's still certainly more optimizations that could be made, but I believe the comment about the H and V traversal is irrelevant since we're traversing across a line anyways.
